### 1. Introduction

The proposed repository focuses on a two-layered approach for placing DLOs on a flat surface using a single robot hand.  The high-level layer is a novel DLO surface placement method based on Euler's elastica solutions. 
The low-level layer forms a pipeline controller. The controller estimates the DLO current shape using a Residual Neural Network (ResNet) and uses feedback to ensure task execution in the presence of modeling and placement errors.  

##### Objective

In order to place the DLO effectively, precise manner and without damage or distortions, the need to make a controlled and well-planned movement.
Our work proposed a novel approach to shape control of DLOs which could have potential applications in the handling of fresh food prodacts.
This is a challenging problem since it requires an online analysis of the current setting of the environment and the current capabilities of the agent. In addition, it requires an integration of high-level task planning and low-level motion control. 

Within the context of this, the placement cycle can be divided into the following tasks:

* Bring the DLO from the transportation process target to the attachment point with the tray.
* Getting the DLO ready for rolling, the tip does not slip and the tray does not slip on the worktable.
* DLO pure rolling until it is placed.

##### Relevance
Manipulation of DLO is relevant to both industrial and household environments.
